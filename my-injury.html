      <!-- my content-->
<p>I've been playing padel a lot lately, and on top of that, I've been going to the gym 5 days weekly. After playing, I wasn't giving my body a good chance to recover; for instance, I wasn't eating well or getting enough sleep and the most crucial thing is drinking water, which I wasn't doing enough of.
  As a result, I started to face some pain in the beginning of my right shoulder. If you're wondering why my right shoulder, it's because I use my right hand for everything and I was not allowing her to recover from my daily workouts after the gym and after the padel games.
<br>
I was playing for some days without eating, which had a significant impact on my ability to focus on both my own needs and those of my right shoulder. The result was that I was facing a lot of pain at the end of the day.
<br>Although my hand was in a lot of pain the day I sustained the injury, I stopped playing and going to the gym from the pain. I did, however, visit the hospital because of the pain. I had an anterior shoulder ligament tear, which was discovered by an x-ray, and the doctor suggested immediate surgery to stop the pain from worsening. I decided that the surgery should be performed right away.
