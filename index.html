<h2><b>About Me</b></h1>
<p>My name is Khalifa and I was born on May 5, 2003.
I have always loved playing sports, Since I was little, I especially enjoyed playing football with my friends.<br> My interests were in sports, and I spent all of my free time doing them. I participated in numerous Bahraini teams. When I was 12 years old, I began playing. I loved eating and watching movies too.But later on my interests was in the ICT field I was discovering more about the graphic design because my dream to make websites for people and this is why I studied computer Science and cyber security to develop my IT skills.

<center><h2><b>My Daily GYM Routine</b></h2>
<p>My weekly meal planning ensures that I have enough healthy food available for the entire week as part of my daily gym routine. Second, as you can see from my schedule below, I practice five days per week. Every Monday and Thursday, my friends and I play padel. I work out in the morning, take a break in the middle of the day, and play padel at night. On the fifth day, I recover, take a break, and get a massage to unwind my body and get enough rest. Every day, I take supplements for my body like <span style="color:blue">gold protein whey and omega 3 that I have.</span><br></p></center>
