I loved eating and watching movies too.But later on my interests was in the ICT field I was discovering more about the graphic design because my dream to make websites for people and this is why I studied computer Science and cyber security to develop my IT skills.

<h3><b>My Daily GYM Routine</b></h3>
<p>My weekly meal planning ensures that I have enough healthy food available for the entire week as part of my daily gym routine. Second, as you can see from my schedule below, I practice five days per week. Every Monday and Thursday, my friends and I play padel. I work out in the morning, take a break in the middle of the day, and play padel at night. On the fifth day, I recover, take a break, and get a massage to unwind my body and get enough rest. Every day, I take supplements for my body like <span style="color:blue">gold protein whey and omega 3 that I have.</span><br></p>
